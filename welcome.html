The establishment of these large shopping malls has greatly facilitated people's lives. However, with the development of the Internet, more and more people choose to shop online, which has brought a huge impact on the traditional physical sales industry. Large-scale shopping malls are often large in scale and complex in internal structure. It is very difficult for consumers to find a certain type of product or find a specific location in a huge shopping mall. Consumers also tend to miss various promotional activities and preferential information in shopping malls. In addition, the underground parking lot of the shopping mall occupies a large area, and consumers often spend a lot of time and energy looking for their own cars, which affects the shopping experience. Managers of large shopping malls have also gradually realized that if they want to survive in the current complex and changeable shopping mode, they need to use information technology to bring customers a better shopping experience, and understand consumers' shopping needs and market developments through data analysis. Therefore, it is of great value to develop a smart shopping guide system for large shopping malls. dui.
